What data do we want to store:
Users(id, screen_name, name)
Follows(id1, id2)
Is this enough?

Must define explicitly what information we store for each user. Can save a lot of API calls.

friends/followers ids:           15 calls in 15 min window. chunk size 5000
friends/followers User objects:  15 calls in 15 min window. chunk size 20


Is sqlite3 a good solution for a database (no server)?
- no server
- no ORM, must use sql queries inside the code
- very easy to setup

Do we want to be able to connect to a remote DB?



Supported actions in server:
- retrieve ids of followers
- retrieve ids of following
- retrieve user information (id, screen_name, name)
what else?


Should the server also support returning results to user (results may be very large), or should it
only affect the database?


Multithreading: should we think about it? What must we consider for working with the database and
make API calls using tweepy?
