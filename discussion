What data do we want to store:
sql DB with Users(id, screen_name, name) and Follows(id1, id2)
Is this enough? Do we want to store an entire User object?

should find a better solution than sqlite3 (don't work with sql statements in python)


Supported actions in server:
- retrieve list of followers (of specific user)
- retrieve list of following (of specific user)



Should the server also support returning result to user(results might be very large), or should it
only affect the database?


Multithreading: should we think about it? What must we consider for working with the database and
make API calls using tweepy?
