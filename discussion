What data do we want to store:
sql DB with Users(id, screen_name, name) and Follows(id1, id2)
Is this enough?



Supported actions in server:
- retrieve list of followers (of specific user)
- retrieve list of following (of specific user)



Should the server also support returning result to user? (results might be very large)
